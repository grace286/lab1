   <p> A rustic village fallen behind, my parents exhausted from their work, a life in financial straits … these 
     gloomy memories were branded on to my young mind, they were my first impression of “fate.” 
     After I started attending school, the first time I heard my teacher say that “You control your fate in your own hands,” 
     I kept these words firmly in my mind. I believed that although I could not change the fact that I was born into poverty, 
     I could still change my own fate through hard work. As a result, I exerted my full strength to wrestle with my “fate,” 
     and gain a slice of heaven to call my own.</p>
